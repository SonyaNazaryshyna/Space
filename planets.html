          <h2>Mercury</h2>
          <p>Mercury, the closest planet to the Sun, is a rocky world with extreme temperature variations. Its surface is heavily cratered, resembling the Earth's moon. With daytime temperatures soaring up to 800°F (430°C) and nighttime temperatures plummeting to -290°F (-180°C), Mercury experiences the most significant temperature swings of any planet in our solar system due to its lack of a substantial atmosphere to retain heat. Despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury isn't the hottest planet; Venus holds that title due to its thick atmosphere trapping heat.
          </p><p>
          Mercury's surface features include vast plains, cliffs, and craters. It lacks significant geological activity, with no evidence of plate tectonics or volcanic activity. Its lack of an atmosphere also means there is no weather to erode its surface features, leaving many craters intact for billions of years. Additionally, Mercury has a relatively large iron core, comprising about 60% of its mass, which contributes to its strong magnetic field—one of the most significant compared to its size in the solar system.</p>

    <h2>Venus</h2>
    <p>Venus, named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty, is often referred to as Earth's sister planet due to their similar size and composition. However, Venus is a hostile world with extreme temperatures and a thick, toxic atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide.</p>
    <p>With surface temperatures reaching a scorching 900°F (475°C), Venus holds the title of the hottest planet in our solar system, even hotter than Mercury due to its dense atmosphere trapping heat. Despite its proximity to the Sun, Venus experiences little temperature variation between day and night.</p>
    <p>Venus's surface is dominated by vast plains covered in volcanic plains and highland regions, with thousands of volcanoes, including some of the largest in the solar system. The planet has no moons and rotates very slowly, with a day on Venus lasting longer than its year.</p>

    <h2>Earth</h2>
    <p>Earth, known as the "Blue Planet," is the third planet from the Sun and the only known world to support life. Its atmosphere, rich in nitrogen and oxygen, sustains a diverse ecosystem. With vast oceans covering about 71% of its surface, Earth is a unique and precious celestial body.</p>
    <p>Home to millions of species, including humans, Earth orbits within the habitable zone, where conditions are ideal for life as we know it. Its magnetic field protects the planet from solar winds and harmful cosmic radiation. Earth's dynamic geology, characterized by tectonic activity and volcanic eruptions, continues to shape its surface over millions of years.</p>

    <h2>Mars</h2>
    <p>Mars, often referred to as the "Red Planet," is the fourth planet from the Sun. With its dusty, rust-colored surface, Mars has captured the imagination of scientists and explorers for centuries. It has a thin atmosphere primarily composed of carbon dioxide, making it inhospitable to life as we know it.</p>
    <p>Despite its harsh conditions, Mars exhibits intriguing geological features, including vast canyons, towering volcanoes, and ancient riverbeds. Evidence suggests that liquid water once flowed on its surface, raising questions about the planet's potential for harboring life in the past. Mars continues to be a focus of exploration for future manned missions and scientific research.</p>

    <h2>Jupiter</h2>
    <p>Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system, is known for its mesmerizing banded appearance and iconic Great Red Spot. It is the fifth planet from the Sun and consists mostly of hydrogen and helium. Jupiter's massive size exerts a powerful gravitational pull, influencing the orbits of nearby celestial bodies.</p>
    <p>With over 79 known moons, including the four Galilean moons — Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto — Jupiter hosts a diverse array of natural satellites. Its turbulent atmosphere is marked by swirling clouds and intense storms, making it a fascinating subject of study for astronomers and planetary scientists alike.</p>

<div class="swiper-slide" id="saturnSlide">      <div class="planet-info">
    <h2>Saturn</h2>
    <p>Saturn, famous for its stunning ring system, is the sixth planet from the Sun. Composed mostly of hydrogen and helium, Saturn's rings consist of icy particles ranging in size from tiny grains to large chunks. These rings orbit the planet in a flat plane, creating a breathtaking spectacle visible even from Earth.</p>
    <p>Despite its immense size, Saturn has the lowest density of all the planets, meaning it would float if placed in water. It boasts over 80 moons, each with its own unique characteristics. Saturn's beauty and mystery continue to captivate scientists and stargazers, inspiring further exploration and discovery.</p>

    <h2>Uranus</h2>
    <p>Uranus, the seventh planet from the Sun, is distinguished by its unique tilt, which causes it to rotate on its side. This unusual orientation gives Uranus its distinct appearance and results in extreme seasonal variations. Its atmosphere is primarily composed of hydrogen, helium, and methane, lending it a bluish-green hue.</p>
    <p>With 27 known moons and a system of faint rings, Uranus is a fascinating yet enigmatic world. Its icy surface conceals a rocky core, and its frigid temperatures make it inhospitable to human life. Despite its remote location in the outer solar system, Uranus continues to intrigue astronomers and researchers.</p>

    <h2>Neptune</h2>
    <p>Neptune, the eighth and farthest planet from the Sun, is a dynamic world characterized by its vivid blue coloration and turbulent atmosphere. Composed primarily of hydrogen, helium, and methane, Neptune's atmosphere hosts powerful storms and high-speed winds, including the infamous Great Dark Spot.</p>
    <p>With 14 known moons and a system of faint rings, Neptune shares many similarities with its neighbor Uranus. Its icy surface conceals a rocky core, and its extreme cold temperatures make it one of the coldest planets in the solar system. Despite its distance from Earth, Neptune remains a subject of fascination for scientists and space explorers.</p>
